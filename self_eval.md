# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I finally found a flow using VS Code and the terminal today, despite some pitfalls with my Github account! A few days ago when I got to an exercise and felt a bit lost, I didn't really know where to turn, which is not an inspiring feeling. Today, I was able to scrub the Ruby Methods links for almost all of the info I needed, and was able to find examples on the internet of any of the methods I was curious to practice. There are still so many more to learn. I hit a lot of walls today, but I powered through and talked to myself out loud to breakdown the logic of what I was doing. Sometimes the questions are worded in a confusing way, sometimes you just need to re-read them a few times in context. I finally understand the difference between built-in methods and written methods, which is crucial for seeing the bigger picture here. 

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

Using methods in applications improves code organization, reusability, and maintainability by encapsulating specific tasks into reusable code blocks with minimal effort.
